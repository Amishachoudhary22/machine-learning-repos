# Book Recommendation System

## Introduction
The Book Recommendation System Project aims to understand the distribution of book ratings and publication years, and recommend well rated books.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

To install: ``pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn``

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading, Exploration, and Cleaning**: The datasets are loaded and then inspected to understand their structure, including the shape, column names, and basic statistics. They are then cleaned to make it understandable.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Univariate analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of ratings and publication years.
3. **Summary Statistics**: Summary statistics was generated for the year of publication.
4. **Handling Outliers and Anomalies**: Identified and handled any anomalies in the publication year.
5. **Boxplot Visualization**: A boxplot was generated to visualize the distribution of publication years.
6. **Filtering Data**: Books with publication years beyond 2022 were filtered out from the dataset.

## Results
1. **Rating Distribution**: The distribution of ratings indicated user preferences and the popularity of books.
2. **Publication Years**: The analysis of publication years showed trends in book releases, with certain years having a higher frequency of publications.
3. **Data Quality**: Identification of missing values and duplicates helped to maintain data integrity for further analysis.
4. **Visualizations**
    - **Count Plot**: A count plot of book ratings showcased user rating patterns.
    - **Bar Chart**: A bar chart of books by year of publication highlighted trends in literature over the decades.

## Conclusion
- This project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of book ratings and publication trends. 
- By utilizing data visualization and analysis techniques, we can identify user preferences, detect anomalies in the dataset, and ensure data quality for future analyses.
